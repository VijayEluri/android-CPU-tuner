CPU tuner gives you control over the power consumption of your android device.
Its prime purpose is to be a battery saver and to save as much battery as possible, but it can be used to overclock at the same time (if the kernel of your device supports it).

Depending on triggers (based on the battery) different profiles are loaded.  Each trigger has different profiles depending of the  the state (if it is locked, on battery, on power or a phone call is being done) of you phone.

A profiles which can modify the following:
* The CPU governor its thresholds and min/max frequencies off your CPU (i.e. setCPU speed).
* The state of services like:
- mobiledata connection
- 3G/2G switch
- background sync
- wifi
- GPS (if installed as system app)
- bluethooth
- airplane mode


Configurations (i.e. a set of trigger and profiles) can be loaded based on the time of the day and the day of the week. This allows you to set a different behavour during the night or the weekend.

You best generate a capabilities report first, by going to settings then to backend and choose capabilities report, when it is done hit send (and save the mail as draft). Then describe your your issue (and if possible attach a logcat output along with the zip file from the report).

A note on permissions:  Yes there are a lot and potentially dangerous permissions needed, but cpu tuner does not request the network communication permission which means that cpu tuner cannot send any information back.  Further more cpu tuner is opensource so you can browse the code and check....
