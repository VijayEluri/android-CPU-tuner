	<span class="text">
		Normally you gain more battery (and speed) by ajusting the governor thresholds and not the frequencies.
	</span>
	<span class="text">
		Keep in mind that high(er) frequencies drain your battery faster, as the CPU works more ("harder") and needs a higher core voltage to operate properly.
		Thereby overclocking leads to more heat, which might damage your phone. Be warned!
	</span>
	<span class="text">
		In reverse this means that your phone will run slower when underclocked, but it will use less energy, which results in a prolonged battery life.
		Clocking too low (<400MHz) may lead to your phone being locked in "sleep" mode - you cannot switch it on with a button-press anymore.
		This is one of the reasons, why clocking below that speed is available in "poweruser" mode only.
