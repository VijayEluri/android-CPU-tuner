	<span class="text">CPU tuner uses a concept of <a href="trigger.html">triggers</a>, 
		<a href="profile.html">profiles</a> and 
		<a href="virtual_governor.html">virtual governors</a>.</span>
	<span class="text"><a href="trigger.html">Triggers</a> are activated on your phone 
		entering a predefined state. They then apply a predefined profile.</span>
	<span class="text">The states are defined by a battery level and the phone's status 
		(locked, active, on power, phone call in progress or even battery hot).</span>
	<span class="text"><a href="profile.html">Profiles</a> are essentially a set of policies that 
		are applied to the phone and change the state of <a href="service.html">services</a> as well as the <a href="virtual_governor.html">governor</a>.</span>
	<span class="text"><a href="virtual_governor.html">Virtual governors</a> are an abstraction of the 
		<a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> and their parameters.</span>
	<span class="text">While doing so, CPU tuner runs event-driven. I.e. it does not run constantly, thus creating only minimal system load on it's own.</span>
	<span class="text">
		How should I use this to <a href="howto_save_battery.html">save battery</a>?
	</span>
	<span class="text">This help also includes a <a href="faq/faq.html">FAQ</a> which you might find 
		helpful/interesting.</span>
	<span class="text">You can find further info on the application's topic in this
		<a href="links.html">link collection</a>.</span>

	<span class="text"><a href="thanks.html">A big THANK YOU goes out to ...</a></span>
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="text"><span class="bold">NOTICE:</span></span>
	<span class="text">To operate as expected, CPU tuner needs a <span class="bold">rooted</span> phone 
		and root permissions granted to it by the user. Be aware that some ROMs don't support 
		adjustment of such deep system parameters!</span>
