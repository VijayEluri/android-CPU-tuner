	<span class="headline">Howto save battery?</span>
	<br/><br/>
	<span class="text">Saving battery is easy: Just turn on airplain mode...<br />
	... but that is probably not what you want!</span>
	<span class="text">
	Saving battery is hard, it depends on the device, the user (i.e. how you use you device) 
	and a lot of cryptic settings.
	</span>
	<span class="text">
	Both statements are true to a certain extent, but in the end tuning your device is 
	just some work and experimenting with the settings.<br/>
	The following hints might help you.
		<ul>
			<li><span class="bold">Switch off the services you do not need.</span><br/>
			Some services like wifi, bluetooth or GPS use quite a lot of battery,
			if you do not need them switch them off (manually preferable).  If you use
			your wifi only at home switch it off when you leave your home.<br/>
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Avoid excessive service switches.</span><br/>
			Switching a service costs battery if you switch a service each time the
			screen goes off, this might cost more battery than it saves.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Start with the default settings of cpu tuner.</span><br/>
			If you got a feeling for how much battery it uses, change 
			<span class="bold">one</span> thing at time. 
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Use the governor thresholds not the cpu frequencies.</span><br/>
			E.g. a ondemand governor with a up threshold of 80% yields a fast but rather 
			battery draining configuration, 
			where as a conservative governor with and up threshold of 98% and a down threshold
			of 90% is a battery saving configuration which makes you device a little slow.  
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Do not trust any readout only trust the battery live.</span></li>
		</ul>
