- make boost profile configurable

- rework tunerservice to be a service (not an intent service)

- introduce categories in profile settings
- label setting cab checker group

- add sampling interval 
sampling_rate: measured in uS (10^-6 seconds), this is how often you
want the kernel to look at the CPU usage and to make decisions on
what to do about the frequency.  Typically this is set to values of
around '10000' or more. It's default value is (cmp. with users-guide.txt):
transition_latency * 1000
Be aware that transition latency is in ns and sampling_rate is in us, so you
get the same sysfs value by default.
Sampling rate should always get adjusted considering the transition latency
To set the sampling rate 750 times as high as the transition latency
in the bash (as said, 1000 is default), do:
echo `$(($(cat cpuinfo_transition_latency) * 750 / 1000)) \
    >ondemand/sampling_rate
(linux/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt)

- advanced statistics: 
	* rework graph to use screen size
	* fix tablet 
	* graph for trigger and or profile

- export config merge to master

- exclude profile switch log from backup
- check for su binary and fix superuser not installed (ics)

- sf web site

- check for changed governors (use pershot kernel)


- ask user to disable log if he does not use it

- sort user configs by time
- timed manual service changes (i.e. change back after a certain time)
- fix hasManualServicesChanges to reflect current trigger and get better answers

- ensure display of current entity in list

- move powerprofile read from service

- check if billing is supported -> old market

- create chooser for homescreen link of configurations (buy?)
- nummeric keyboard for pulse lengthes 
- buy configs
- message in config manage if sd card is not accessible
- refresh config list if sdcard gets mounted
- rework help for configurations and autoload
- enable/disable services in settings

- pulse timing for each triggers
- add ignore nice load

- check if wifi is present before enabling
- do not switch bluetooth while connected (not paired/bonded) (possible?)
- add controls for 4G(wimax, HSDPA and HSUPA) how to figure out if it works/is supported
- set brightness
